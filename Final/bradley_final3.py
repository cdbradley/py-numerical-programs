# we look at the results surrounding 20 times steps, and see that -3.71 is consistant, so we belive that. 
#This also matches when we take a large number of steps, as seen in the final calculation
#We beleive 3 significant digits, (two to the right of the decimal place) meaning that we believe -3.71 at 20 time steps
